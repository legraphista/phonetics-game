the goal of this game is to make a grid 3x3/4x4/5x5 of word chunks(2/3 letters long) and the player has to guess what words are displayed
the fatser they guess and the lonter the word relative the the longest word available on the board, the higher the score
also the turn has a time limit (30 sec maybe?)
